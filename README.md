## Customization

To customize this portfolio for your own use:

1. Replace the profile images in the `assets/` directory with your own photos.
2. Update the text content in `index.html` to reflect your personal information, skills, and projects.
3. Modify the styling in `style.css` and `mediaqueries.css` to match your preferred color scheme and layout.
4. Update the `script.js` file if you want to add or modify any interactive features.

## Dark Mode

The website includes a dark mode feature. Users can toggle between light and dark modes by clicking the moon/sun icon in the navigation bar. The chosen mode is saved in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes. The `mediaqueries.css` file contains styles for different viewport widths, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
